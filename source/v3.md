# Cozy 3 (Coming in 2017)

## Tools

We use **Go** and **CouchDB** as our main technologies.

**Go** (often referred as golang) is an open source programming language created at Google in 2007.

**CouchDB** is surely less-known, but definitely reliable. As a proper Erlang program, it has proven its strength and stability. A consistent, well-documented API, plus wonderful replication capabilities: the recipe of what we love of a database engine.

For now, most of the documentation of the new stack is available in [the repository of the new stack](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/tree/master/docs).
